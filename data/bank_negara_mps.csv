6-May-21,0,1.75,"At its meeting today, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) of Bank Negara Malaysia decided to maintain the Overnight Policy Rate (OPR) at 1.75 percent.The global economic recovery continues to strengthen, particularly in the major economies, supported by improvements in manufacturing and trade activity, although the pace may vary across countries. The ongoing roll-out of vaccination programmes and sizeable fiscal stimulus measures in the US as well as policy support in other major economies will further facilitate an improvement in domestic demand. However, the recovery trajectory in some economies could be disrupted by a re-tightening of containment measures to curb COVID-19 resurgences. Recent financial market volatility has somewhat receded, and financial conditions remain supportive of growth. The balance of risks to the growth outlook remains tilted to the downside, due mainly to uncertainty over the path of the pandemic as well as potential risks of heightened financial market volatility.For Malaysia, latest indicators point to continued improvements in economic activity in the first quarter and into April. While the recent re-imposition of containment measures in select locations will affect economic activity in the short term, the impact will be less severe as almost all economic sectors are allowed to operate. The growth trajectory is projected to improve, driven by the stronger recovery in global demand and increased public and private sector expenditure amid continued support from policy measures. Growth will also be supported by higher production from existing and new manufacturing facilities, particularly in the E&E and primary-related sub-sectors, as well as oil and gas facilities. The progress of the domestic COVID-19 vaccine programme will also lift sentiments and contribute towards recovery in economic activity. The growth outlook, however, remains subject to downside risks, stemming mainly from ongoing uncertainties in developments related to the pandemic, and potential challenges that might affect the roll-out of vaccines both globally and domestically.Headline inflation in 2021 is projected to average higher between 2.5% and 4.0%, primarily due to the cost-push factor of higher global oil prices. In terms of trajectory, headline inflation is anticipated to temporarily spike in the second quarter of 2021, due particularly to the lower base from the low domestic retail fuel prices in the corresponding quarter of 2020. However, this will be transitory as headline inflation is projected to moderate thereafter as this base effect dissipates. Underlying inflation, as measured by core inflation, is expected to remain subdued, averaging between 0.5% and 1.5% for the year, amid continued spare capacity in the economy. The outlook, however, is subject to global oil and commodity price developments.The MPC considers the stance of monetary policy to be appropriate and accommodative. Given the uncertainties surrounding the pandemic, the stance of monetary policy going forward will continue to be determined by new data and information, and their implications on the overall outlook for inflation and domestic growth.

As a result, growth for 2020 is expected to be near the lower end of the earlier forecasted range. For 2021, while near-term growth will be affected by the re-introduction of stricter containment measures, the impact will be less severe than that experienced in 2020. The growth trajectory is projected to improve from the second quarter onwards. The improvement will be driven by the recovery in global demand, turnaround in public and private sector expenditure amid continued support from policy measures, and higher production from existing and new manufacturing and mining facilities.

Substantial policy stimuli introduced by many economies, coupled with the gradual easing of containment measures globally, would partially mitigate the economic impact of COVID-19. Growth prospects should improve in 2021 with the expected containment of the pandemic.For Malaysia, domestic economic conditions have similarly been affected by the pandemic. Widespread containment measures globally, international border closures and the consequent weak external demand environment will exert a larger drag on domestic economic activity. The Movement Control Order, while necessary to contain the spread of the virus, has also constrained production capacity and spending. Labour market conditions are also expected to weaken considerably. Economic conditions would be particularly challenging in the first half of the year. The fiscal stimulus measures, alongside monetary and financial measures will, however, offer some support to the economy.

The outlook for growth continues to be subject to a high degree of uncertainty, particularly with respect to developments surrounding the pandemic.Inflationary pressures are expected to be muted in 2020, with average headline inflation likely to be negative this year, due mainly to projections for substantially lower global oil prices.

The growth of financing to the private sector has been sustained and is supportive of economic activity. With the economy firmly on a steady growth path, the MPC decided to normalise the degree of monetary accommodation. At the same time, the MPC recognises the need to pre-emptively ensure that the stance of monetary policy is appropriate to prevent the build-up of risks that could arise from interest rates being too low for a prolonged period of time.

The ringgit, along with most emerging market currencies, has experienced sharp adjustments and significant volatility due to continuing uncertainties in global economic and policy environment, and geopolitical developments. These factors could result in periods of volatility in the regional financial and foreign exchange markets. In this regard, Bank Negara Malaysia will continue to provide liquidity to ensure the orderly functioning of the domestic foreign exchange market. The capital market remains accessible, deep and liquid. Banking system liquidity is ample. Financial institutions continue to operate with strong capital and liquidity buffers and the growth of financing to the private sector is consistent with the pace of economic activity. At the current level of the OPR, the degree of monetary accommodativeness is consistent with the policy stance to ensure that the domestic economy continues on a steady growth path amid stable inflation, supported by continued healthy financial intermediation in the economy. The risk of destabilising financial imbalances has been contained. However, the MPC will be monitoring these risks to ensure the sustainability of the overall growth prospects. The meeting also approved the schedule of MPC meetings for 2017. In accordance with the Central Bank of Malaysia Act 2009, the MPC will convene six times during the year. The meetings will be held over two days, with the Monetary Policy Statement released at 3 p.m. on the second day of the MPC meeting.

Going forward, downside risks to global growth remain high following uncertainty over the growth momentum and policy shifts in major economies, and unresolved issues post the EU referendum in the United Kingdom.For Malaysia, growth moderated slightly in the second quarter of the year, following weaker net exports and a drawdown in stocks. Domestic demand, however, remained the key driver of growth, with private consumption and private investment growing at a faster pace. Going forward, private consumption will remain supported by wage and employment growth, with additional impetus coming from announced Government measures to increase disposable income.

Although growth across the advanced economies has improved, it has remained modest. In most of Asia, while there has been a moderation in growth, domestic demand continues to support economic activity. Looking ahead, while the global economic recovery is expected to continue, the downside risks to growth have increased arising from the moderating growth momentum in the major emerging market economies, uncertainty in commodity prices and the heightened volatility in financial markets.For Malaysia, recent indicators suggest continued expansion in economic activity in the third quarter despite ongoing adjustments to external and domestic developments. Private consumption is expected to moderate as households continue to adjust to the implementation of the Goods and Services Tax (GST) and the more uncertain economic environment. Household spending will however be supported by wage growth and stable labour market conditions. Investment activity is projected to be led by capital spending in the manufacturing and services sectors, and ongoing infrastructure projects. The continued expansion in domestic demand is expected to contribute towards mitigating the weak performance of the external sector. Going forward, downside risks to growth, however, have risen amid greater uncertainty on both the global and domestic fronts. Of significance, Malaysia is entering this challenging period from a position of strength given the diversified sources of growth of the economy, low unemployment level, manageable level of external indebtedness, and a well-capitalised banking system. The assessment is therefore for the economic growth to remain within the region of 4.5 to 5.5 percent.Headline inflation averaged at 2.9% in June and July reflecting higher domestic fuel prices and the impact of the GST. Despite the weaker ringgit exchange rate, the impact on overall inflation has been limited by the lower commodity prices and the generally low global inflation. Moving forward, headline inflation is expected to peak in early 2016 and it will moderate for the remainder of the year.While global and domestic developments have continued to affect the ringgit exchange rate and domestic financial markets, overall domestic liquidity conditions remain stable. The financial system remains sound, with healthy growth in financing. Financial intermediation has therefore continued to support the economy.The ringgit exchange rate is being affected by global factors that are affecting many emerging and commodity producing economies. These factors include the weaker commodity prices, the strength of the U.S. dollar, and the uncertainty in the global financial markets. The ringgit exchange rate will reflect the underlying fundamentals of the economy when the external and domestic uncertainties recede. Bank Negara Malaysia will continue to ensure the orderly functioning of the money and foreign exchange markets.At the current level of the OPR, the stance of monetary policy remains accommodative and supportive of economic activity. The MPC recognises that there are heightened risks in the global economic and financial environment. These risks are being carefully monitored to assess their implications on macroeconomic stability and the prospects of the Malaysian economy. This is to ensure that the monetary policy stance is consistent with the sustainability of the overall growth prospects. At the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) meeting today, Bank Negara Malaysia decided to maintain the Overnight Policy Rate (OPR) at 3.25 percent.The global economy continues to expand at a moderate pace. Although growth across the advanced economies has improved, it has remained modest. In most of Asia, while there has been a moderation in growth, domestic demand continues to support economic activity. Looking ahead, while the global economic recovery is expected to continue, the downside risks to growth have increased arising from the moderating growth momentum in the major emerging market economies, uncertainty in commodity prices and the heightened volatility in financial markets.For Malaysia, recent indicators suggest continued expansion in economic activity in the third quarter despite ongoing adjustments to external and domestic developments. Private consumption is expected to moderate as households continue to adjust to the implementation of the Goods and Services Tax (GST) and the more uncertain economic environment. Household spending will however be supported by wage growth and stable labour market conditions. Investment activity is projected to be led by capital spending in the manufacturing and services sectors, and ongoing infrastructure projects. The continued expansion in domestic demand is expected to contribute towards mitigating the weak performance of the external sector.

Growth will be underpinned by the firm expansion of domestic demand.  Sustained employment conditions and income growth is expected to provide support to private consumption, while private investment is projected to strengthen amidst the improved investment environment. The developments in Japan are expected to have a limited impact on the overall domestic economy.  Positive prospects for the region and strong demand for commodities are expected to continue to support the Malaysian economy.Domestic headline inflation has continued to increase, rising to 3% in March to average 2.8% for the first quarter of 2011. The increase was mainly due to higher food and fuel prices. The assessment is that supply factors will continue to be a key determinant affecting consumer prices. Global commodity and energy prices are projected to remain elevated during the year, with inflation in major trading partners also expected to rise further.  There are also some signs that domestic demand factors could exert upward pressure on prices in the second half of the year.With the economy firmly on a steady growth path, the MPC decided to adjust the degree of monetary accommodation.  At the current OPR level, the stance of monetary policy remains supportive of growth.

Several regional economies have reported positive growth in the third quarter, indicating that recovery in the region is ongoing. Notwithstanding these improvements, the outlook for the global economy continues to be uncertain, with recovery likely to be slow and uneven in view of the ongoing adjustments.In the domestic economy, stronger evidence has emerged to suggest that conditions are improving and a recovery in economic activity is gaining some strength. These improvements are more broad-based and are reflected in stronger labour market conditions, consumer and business sentiments, industrial production, financing activity and external trade. These positive developments are expected to continue into 2010, with growth in the domestic economy expected to continue to be supported by existing policy measures and the growing confidence in the private sector.Consumer prices declined at a slower rate in September. The decline in prices largely reflects the cumulative fall in fuel prices since June 2008 and the easing pressure on food prices. The decline in consumer prices, however, is expected to be temporary. Excluding further unanticipated price adjustments and external influences, inflation in 2010 is projected to be positive but remain subdued.With improving domestic economic conditions, and as price pressures and inflationary expectations are expected to remain contained going forward, the assessment is that the current monetary policy stance is appropriate and will continue to provide support to economic activity.

Regional economies have also recorded a sharp economic slowdown in the first quarter. While the near-term economic outlook will continue to remain weak, the implementation of large stimulus measures by several countries has increased the prospects for economic conditions to improve in the second half of the year. Further progress in the financial sector resolution has also been made in several advanced economies, the success of which is a key precondition for the stabilisation of economic and financial conditions.The sharply adverse global developments have resulted in steep declines in Malaysia's exports and industrial production, which have in turn affected private sector activity and labour market conditions. The economy, therefore, is expected to record a marked contraction in the first quarter of 2009. These conditions are expected to prevail until the second quarter of the year. Nevertheless, some signs of moderation in the pace of decline in economic activity have emerged. The current assessment is that the domestic economy is expected to improve in the second half of 2009, supported by stabilisation in global economic conditions and the larger impetus from the implementation of the fiscal stimulus measures.Meanwhile, inflation decelerated to 3.5 percent in March, and is expected to moderate further amid subdued demand conditions and lower external price pressures.Going forward, the implementation of the fiscal stimulus measures, and the accommodative monetary environment following the previous reductions in the OPR, will provide support to domestic economic activity.

25-Aug-08,0,3.5,"At the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) meeting today, Bank Negara Malaysia decided to leave the Overnight Policy Rate (OPR) unchanged at 3.50 percent.Since the previous MPC meeting, the global economy has weakened further with growing evidence of a deterioration of economic performance across a number of the developed economies. This has been the outcome of financial stress, tight credit conditions, asset market weakness and the impact of higher energy and commodity prices. There are also now signs of moderating growth in several emerging economies.The Malaysian economy has been affected by these developments. Although the export sector has benefited from the high energy and commodity prices, the slower global growth is expected to exert a moderating impact on exports. In addition, domestic demand is being affected by the deflationary impact of higher energy and food prices, the softening labour market conditions, and the more challenging business environment.Domestic inflation is expected to remain high for the remaining part of 2008 and going into early 2009, primarily reflecting the first-round effects of the adjustments in energy prices, and the higher commodity and food prices. Indicators such as the Producer Price Index continue to show that businesses are still facing rising operating costs. However, competitive pressures and slowing demand are likely to contain the pass-through to consumer prices. The recent decline in commodity prices is also likely to ease these cost pressures. Overall, the weaker economic conditions will reduce the likelihood of second-round effects that will generate persistent inflationary trends. The assessment is therefore that inflation is expected to moderate substantially in the second-half of 2009.Consequently, the Bank maintains the assessment that with the expected moderation in inflation in the medium term, the greater priority is to avoid a fundamental downturn in economic activity. The current level of the OPR is consistent with this outlook. Going forward, the Bank will maintain its focus on the medium term outlook for inflation and growth, and will carefully assess global and domestic developments in setting the stance of monetary policy. At the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) meeting today, Bank Negara Malaysia decided to leave the Overnight Policy Rate (OPR) unchanged at 3.50 percent.Since the previous MPC meeting, the global economy has weakened further with growing evidence of a deterioration of economic performance across a number of the developed economies. This has been the outcome of financial stress, tight credit conditions, asset market weakness and the impact of higher energy and commodity prices. There are also now signs of moderating growth in several emerging economies.The Malaysian economy has been affected by these developments. Although the export sector has benefited from the high energy and commodity prices, the slower global growth is expected to exert a moderating impact on exports. In addition, domestic demand is being affected by the deflationary impact of higher energy and food prices, the softening labour market conditions, and the more challenging business environment.Domestic inflation is expected to remain high for the remaining part of 2008 and going into early 2009, primarily reflecting the first-round effects of the adjustments in energy prices, and the higher commodity and food prices. Indicators such as the Producer Price Index continue to show that businesses are still facing rising operating costs. However, competitive pressures and slowing demand are likely to contain the pass-through to consumer prices. The recent decline in commodity prices is also likely to ease these cost pressures. Overall, the weaker economic conditions will reduce the likelihood of second-round effects that will generate persistent inflationary trends. The assessment is therefore that inflation is expected to moderate substantially in the second-half of 2009.

The assessment is for a slower global growth with a more protracted and significant slowdown in a number of the developed economies and some moderation in growth in the emerging economies. At the same time, commodity and energy prices are expected to remain at elevated levels, thus fuelling inflation in the global economy.The performance of the Malaysian economy in the first-half of 2008 has been driven by robust domestic demand and reinforced by favourable export performance. The recent major restructuring of domestic energy prices to bring prices closer to the substantially higher international prices is intended to reduce the fundamental distortions that it might create, and to ensure fiscal sustainability. These adjustments are expected to have a deflationary effect on the economy in the second half of this year and into the early part of 2009.The adjustments to the higher international energy and commodity prices have translated into higher domestic consumer prices. In June, consumer price inflation increased by 7.7%, of which about 41% of the increase in inflation was due to the increase in transportation costs while another 41% of the increase has been due to higher prices for food and non-alcoholic beverages.The Bank is projecting inflation to remain elevated in the second-half of this year and into early next year before moderating towards the middle of 2009. The average inflation for 2008 is projected to be in the range of 5.5-6.0%. The inflation rate is expected to moderate in the second half of 2009 in the context of a more moderate growth environment. Currently, much of the significant rise in inflation is due to the increase in fuel prices. At this stage, the concern is for broader price increases and second-round effects, which would result in inflation being persistent. In such circumstances, the appropriate monetary policy response will be taken in order to maintain medium term price stability and ensure that the high inflation does not undermine the longer term growth prospects of the Malaysian economy.In the next twelve months, while both the risks to higher inflation and the risks to slower growth have increased, the immediate concern is to avoid a fundamental economic slowdown that would involve higher unemployment. Slowing growth itself will contribute to containing the potential for second round effects on inflation, thereby containing further increases in prices in the second-half of 2009. Given the underlying fundamental strength of the economy, and the resilient banking sector, the Bank’s assessment is that after this transitional period, the Malaysian economy has the potential to reestablish its medium term growth path.Based on this assessment, the Monetary Policy Committee has decided to keep the Overnight Policy Rate unchanged at 3.50%.

However, there is now clearer evidence of the slowing growth in the major economies. This moderation in growth is expected to be felt by the regional economies, including Malaysia, during the second half of the year.Despite the signs of slowing global growth, commodity and food prices have continued to increase. In particular, oil prices have spiralled up in recent weeks. Domestic consumer price inflation in Malaysia increased to 3 percent in April 2008 and is primarily being driven by higher food prices. There are strong upside risks to global inflation due to sustained high food and energy prices. While such pressures are likely to ease should global growth moderate, in the more immediate term, domestic price pressures are likely to be sustained.The MPC views the latest data on key international and domestic economic variables as being supportive of its assessment that going forward, the risks to inflation are on the upside, while the risks to growth are on the downside. Should the balance of risks shift towards higher inflation, the Bank will undertake the appropriate monetary policy measures. At this stage the risks are assessed to be about balanced, and consequently, the Bank has decided to maintain the current stance of monetary policy.

This is likely to lead to slower global growth in the months ahead. While the slower external demand will have some moderating impact on the Malaysian economy, growth continues to be supported by an expansion in domestic demand. The strong imports of capital goods, manufacturing investment approvals and foreign direct investment inflows are indicators of sustained investment activity. Despite the global financial turmoil, domestic credit conditions have remained favourable as demand for financing continues to be supported by the ample liquidity in the financial system.Global energy and food prices have risen sharply since the beginning of the year from their already high levels. A major uncertainty at this stage is the extent of the moderation in global economic activity and the impact it will have in reducing global price pressures. Domestic food prices have risen in response to the increase in global prices. The increase in food prices reflect a structural phenomenon requiring measures that ensure the adequacy of supply, create appropriate incentive structures that promote higher food production, and enhance the efficiency of the production and distribution chain. In order to ensure a smooth transition to market prices, adjustments to administered prices need to be gradual. The Bank’s forecast of 2.5-3% average inflation in 2008 has built in some administered price adjustments.

The continued improvements in productivity growth, a more competitive environment and adequate expansion in capacity are factors that will reduce the inflation risk for Malaysia.The current stance of monetary policy will therefore be maintained to support growth. The overnight policy rate will continue to remain unchanged at the current level of 2.70%.",2004,Q4-2004
25-Aug-04,0,2.7,"Robust activity in the second quarter of 2004 has raised output growth to 8.0%, the highest quarterly growth since the third quarter of 2000. The main impetus to growth emanated from stronger private sector expenditure and sustained high growth in external demand.Notwithstanding the stronger aggregate demand and higher global energy prices, the domestic inflation rate, as measured by the Consumer Price Index, remained low at 1.2% in the second quarter. The underlying inflation in the economy is expected to remain low. On the supply side, producers have also responded with new investments and capacity expansion in key sectors of the economy. Competition and stable conditions in the labour market, as well as productivity improvements have also contributed to the low inflation. Under these circumstances, the current stance of monetary policy will be maintained to support growth. The overnight policy rate will therefore remain unchanged at 2.70%.

26-May-04,0,2.7,"The Malaysian economy expanded by 7.6% in the first quarter of 2004. The robust economic growth was supported by stronger expansion in private sector demand, both consumption and investment demand, and more buoyant export growth arising from sustained expansion in global economic activity.Going forward, the economic outlook for Malaysia remains favourable. The sustained expansion in domestic aggregate demand is expected to continue to be reinforced by strong performance of the export sector. On the domestic front, rising consumer and investor confidence and improving earnings of both household and corporate sectors suggest that the upturn in private sector demand would be maintained.Inflation continues to remain low. The inflation rate, as measured by the Consumer Price Index, rose by 1% in the first four months of 2004. Domestic price pressures are expected to remain subdued, with the recovery in private investment activity seen mainly in capacity expansion in sectors experiencing strong growth. Importantly, higher productivity is supporting real wage growth. Competition is also moderating price pressures.The underlying fundamentals will continue to accord flexibility for monetary policy to support stronger economic activities, without creating inflationary pressures. Interest rates can remain low for some time to come to support the growth momentum. The overnight policy rate (OPR) will therefore remain unchanged at 2.70%.
