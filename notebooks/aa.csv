0,6-May-21,0,1.75,"At its meeting today, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) of Bank Negara Malaysia decided to maintain the Overnight Policy Rate (OPR) at 1.75 percent.The global economic recovery continues to strengthen, particularly in the major economies, supported by improvements in manufacturing and trade activity, although the pace may vary across countries. The ongoing roll-out of vaccination programmes and sizeable fiscal stimulus measures in the US as well as policy support in other major economies will further facilitate an improvement in domestic demand. However, the recovery trajectory in some economies could be disrupted by a re-tightening of containment measures to curb COVID-19 resurgences. Recent financial market volatility has somewhat receded, and financial conditions remain supportive of growth. The balance of risks to the growth outlook remains tilted to the downside, due mainly to uncertainty over the path of the pandemic as well as potential risks of heightened financial market volatility.For Malaysia, latest indicators point to continued improvements in economic activity in the first quarter and into April. While the recent re-imposition of containment measures in select locations will affect economic activity in the short term, the impact will be less severe as almost all economic sectors are allowed to operate. The growth trajectory is projected to improve, driven by the stronger recovery in global demand and increased public and private sector expenditure amid continued support from policy measures. Growth will also be supported by higher production from existing and new manufacturing facilities, particularly in the E&E and primary-related sub-sectors, as well as oil and gas facilities. The progress of the domestic COVID-19 vaccine programme will also lift sentiments and contribute towards recovery in economic activity. The growth outlook, however, remains subject to downside risks, stemming mainly from ongoing uncertainties in developments related to the pandemic, and potential challenges that might affect the roll-out of vaccines both globally and domestically.Headline inflation in 2021 is projected to average higher between 2.5% and 4.0%, primarily due to the cost-push factor of higher global oil prices. In terms of trajectory, headline inflation is anticipated to temporarily spike in the second quarter of 2021, due particularly to the lower base from the low domestic retail fuel prices in the corresponding quarter of 2020. However, this will be transitory as headline inflation is projected to moderate thereafter as this base effect dissipates. Underlying inflation, as measured by core inflation, is expected to remain subdued, averaging between 0.5% and 1.5% for the year, amid continued spare capacity in the economy. The outlook, however, is subject to global oil and commodity price developments.The MPC considers the stance of monetary policy to be appropriate and accommodative. Given the uncertainties surrounding the pandemic, the stance of monetary policy going forward will continue to be determined by new data and information, and their implications on the overall outlook for inflation and domestic growth. The Bank remains committed to utilise its policy levers as appropriate to foster enabling conditions for a sustainable economic recovery.

However, the recent resurgences of COVID-19 cases and the subsequent containment measures have affected economic activity in several major economies. The expedited roll-out of mass vaccination programmes, together with ongoing policy support, are expected to lift global growth prospects going forward. Financial conditions also remain supportive. The overall outlook remains subject to downside risks, primarily if there is further resurgence of COVID-19 infections and delays in mass inoculation against COVID-19.For Malaysia, the resurgence in COVID-19 cases and the introduction of targeted containment measures has affected the recovery momentum in the fourth quarter of 2020. As a result, growth for 2020 is expected to be near the lower end of the earlier forecasted range. For 2021, while near-term growth will be affected by the re-introduction of stricter containment measures, the impact will be less severe than that experienced in 2020. The growth trajectory is projected to improve from the second quarter onwards. The improvement will be driven by the recovery in global demand, turnaround in public and private sector expenditure amid continued support from policy measures, and higher production from existing and new manufacturing and mining facilities. The roll-out of vaccines in the coming months will also lift sentiments. Downside risks to the outlook remain, stemming mainly from ongoing uncertainties surrounding the dynamics of the pandemic and potential challenges that might affect the roll-out of vaccines both globally and domestically.In line with earlier assessments, the average headline inflation is expected to be negative in 2020 due mainly to the substantially lower global oil prices.

Global economic conditions remain weak with global growth projected to be negative for the year. Although a trough is expected in the second quarter, broad-based weakness in labour markets and precautionary behaviour by households and businesses could affect the recovery going forward. Several major economies have begun relaxing measures to contain the COVID-19 pandemic, leading to the gradual resumption of economic activity. Financial conditions have improved, although risk aversion remains elevated. Downside risks to the global outlook remain, especially if a resurgence of the pandemic necessitates the reintroduction of containment measures.For Malaysia, economic activity contracted sharply in the second quarter of the year, due to measures introduced to contain the pandemic globally and domestically. Following the gradual and progressive re-opening of the economy since early May, economic activities have begun to recover from the trough in the second quarter. The fiscal stimulus packages, alongside monetary and financial measures, will continue to underpin the improving economic outlook. The projected improvement in the domestic economy is expected to be further supported by a gradual recovery in global growth conditions. The pace and strength of the recovery, however, remain subject to downside risks emanating from both domestic and external factors. These include the prospect of further outbreaks of the pandemic leading to re-impositions of containment measures, more persistent weakness in labour market conditions, and a weaker-than-expected recovery in global growth.Inflationary pressures are expected to be muted in 2020. Average headline inflation is likely to be negative this year, primarily reflecting the substantially lower global oil prices. The risks of a broad-based and persistent decline in prices are assessed to be limited as economic activity resumes and demand conditions improve. Nevertheless, the outlook remains significantly affected by global oil and commodity prices. Underlying inflation is expected to be subdued and within expectations.The reduction in the OPR provides additional policy stimulus to accelerate the pace of economic recovery.

Widespread containment measures globally, international border closures and the consequent weak external demand environment will exert a larger drag on domestic economic activity. The Movement Control Order, while necessary to contain the spread of the virus, has also constrained production capacity and spending. Labour market conditions are also expected to weaken considerably. Economic conditions would be particularly challenging in the first half of the year.

Downside risks to the global growth outlook have increased, particularly in the near term. However, a number of countries have implemented policy responses. With further anticipated policy measures, these actions are expected to mitigate the economic impact of COVID-19.The Malaysian economy grew at a moderate pace of 4.3% in 2019. Looking ahead, growth, particularly in the first quarter, will be affected by the COVID-19 outbreak primarily in the tourism-related and manufacturing sectors. The weakness in the agriculture sector is also likely to persist in the first quarter. For 2020, private and public sector activities will be supportive of growth. Household spending is expected to grow at a slower pace amid moderate employment and income growth. Investment activity is projected to record a modest recovery, underpinned by ongoing and new projects, both in the public and private sectors. The 2020 economic stimulus package will also provide some support to economic activity.

Going forward, geopolitical tensions, policy uncertainty and the unresolved trade disputes could exacerbate financial market volatility and further weigh on the global growth outlook. Monetary easing and other policy measures are expected to provide some support to growth.For the Malaysian economy, latest indicators are in line with expectations, suggesting moderate expansion of economic activity for the third quarter. Going forward, growth is expected to remain anchored by firm private sector expenditure. While private investment is projected to remain modest, household spending will be supported by continued employment and wage growth. The recent Government measures will provide additional impetus to economic activity. On the external front, while exports will continue to be affected by slower global demand, this will be partly mitigated by its diversified structure. Overall, growth of the Malaysian economy is expected to be within projections in 2019 and the pace sustained going into 2020. This projection remains subject to downside risks, mainly stemming from uncertainties in global economic and financial conditions as well as weakness in commodity-related sectors.Average headline inflation in 2019 will be low. In 2020, headline inflation is expected to average higher but remain modest. This reflects mainly the lapse in the impact from consumption tax policy changes, the lifting of the domestic retail fuel price ceiling amid the relatively subdued outlook on global oil prices, and measures in place to contain food prices.

The recent escalation of trade tensions point to weaker global trade going forward, with increasing signs of spillovers to domestic economic activity in a number of countries. Monetary policy easing in several major economies has eased global financial conditions, but uncertainty from the prolonged trade disputes and geopolitical developments could lead to excessive financial market volatility.For Malaysia, the stronger economic growth performance in the second quarter of 2019 was underpinned by the resilience of private spending amid broad-based expansion in key economic sectors. Going forward, these domestic drivers of growth, alongside stable labour market and wage growth, are expected to remain supportive of economic activity. On the external front, Malaysia’s diversified exports will partly mitigate the impact of softening global demand. Overall, the baseline growth projection for 2019 remains unchanged, within the range of 4.3% - 4.8%. This projection, however, is subject to further downside risks from worsening trade tensions, uncertainties in the global and domestic environment, and extended weakness in commodity-related sectors.Average headline inflation year-to-date is 0.3%. Headline inflation is projected to average higher for the remaining months of the year and into 2020.  However, headline inflation is expected to remain low. This reflects the lapse in the impact of consumption tax policy changes, the relatively subdued outlook on global oil prices, and policy measures in place to contain food prices.

15,8-Nov-18,0,3.25,"At its meeting today, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) of Bank Negara Malaysia decided to maintain the Overnight Policy Rate (OPR) at 3.25 percent.The global economic expansion continues, although with signs of moderating momentum. In the advanced economies, growth will continue to be mainly driven by positive labour market conditions and policy support. Growth in Asia will be supported by domestic activity amid weaker external demand. Risks to the global growth outlook remain tilted to the downside, with trade tensions continuing to be a key source of downside risk. Continued volatility in international financial markets and monetary policy normalisation in some advanced economies could lead to further capital outflows and financial market adjustments in emerging economies.For the Malaysian economy, latest indicators point towards continued expansion in private sector activity. Private consumption will remain the main driver of growth, supported by conducive labour market conditions. Investment activity is projected to be sustained by continued capacity expansion in key sectors, driven by positive demand and efforts to enhance automation. Public sector spending, however, is likely to weigh on growth, amid continued reprioritisation of expenditure by the Government. The recent announcements by the Government have provided more clarity on fiscal and economic development policies. On the external front, exports are projected to provide an additional lift to growth, albeit to a lesser extent, due to moderating global growth momentum. The domestic economy continues to face downside risks stemming from any further escalation in trade tensions and prolonged weakness in the mining and agriculture sectors. Nevertheless, on balance, the Malaysian economy is expected to remain on a steady growth path in 2018 and 2019.The annual average headline inflation will be low in 2018. Moving into 2019, headline inflation is projected to increase primarily due to higher projected global oil prices and the floating of domestic fuel prices. While the impact of the consumption tax policy will contribute to higher headline inflation in 2019, it will lapse towards the end of 2019. Underlying inflation is expected to remain contained in the absence of strong demand pressures.In line with regional economies, the domestic financial markets continue to experience non-resident portfolio outflows due to global developments. Nevertheless, the financial markets remain orderly with domestic monetary and financial conditions supportive of economic growth. The financial sector is sound, with financial institutions operating with strong capital and liquidity buffers. Importantly, the domestic economy maintains its underlying fundamental strength, with steady economic growth, low unemployment and surplus in the current account of the balance of payments.

16,5-Sep-18,0,3.25,"At its meeting today, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) of Bank Negara Malaysia decided to maintain the Overnight Policy Rate (OPR) at 3.25 percent.The global economic expansion is continuing, albeit with increasing divergence across economies and signs of a slower momentum. In the advanced economies, growth will remain underpinned by strong labour market conditions and policy support. In Asia, growth will be supported by sustained domestic activity and external demand. Although global growth is currently sustained, risks to growth have increased. Trade tensions continue to be a key source of downside risk. Greater volatility in the international financial markets and monetary policy normalisation in the advanced economies could lead to further capital outflows and financial market adjustments in emerging economies.For Malaysia, supply disruptions in the mining and agriculture sectors led to more moderate growth in the second quarter of 2018. On the demand side, growth remained supported by private sector activity with further impetus from net exports. Looking ahead, private consumption, which was boosted by the tax holiday, will continue to be driven by steady wage and employment growth. Investment activity is projected to be underpinned by continued capacity expansion in key sectors, particularly in the export-oriented industries, driven by favourable demand and efforts to enhance automation. Public sector spending however is expected to weigh on growth as the Government embarks on reprioritisation of expenditure. The external sector will continue to benefit from the sustained global growth momentum. In the immediate term, the economy faces downside risks stemming from heightened trade tensions, prolonged weakness in the mining and agriculture sectors and some domestic policy uncertainty. On balance, the Malaysian economy is expected to remain on a steady growth path.Headline inflation was at 0.9% in July 2018. Going forward and continuing into 2019, headline inflation is expected to edge upwards taking into consideration the impact of policy measures on domestic cost factors. The impact of the changes in the consumption tax policy on headline inflation will be transitory and lapse towards the end of 2019. Underlying inflation is nevertheless expected to remain relatively stable.In line with regional economies, the domestic financial markets continue to experience non-resident portfolio outflows due to ongoing global developments. Despite these adjustments, domestic financial markets remain resilient with domestic monetary and financial conditions supportive of economic growth.

The positive growth performance is expected to be sustained, driven by both domestic and external demand. Private consumption will be underpinned by continued wage and employment growth, with an additional lift from higher household spending due to the tax holiday. Investment activity is projected to be supported by capacity expansion mainly in the export-oriented industries and ongoing infrastructure projects, particularly in the transport and utilities sub-sectors. The external sector will continue to benefit from the sustained global growth momentum. The growth outlook will be further supported with greater certainty in domestic policy in the coming months. Overall, the Malaysian economy is expected to remain on a steady growth path.Headline inflation for 2018 is projected to be lower than earlier forecast taking into consideration the impact of recent policy measures on domestic cost factors. The impact of these measures on inflation, however, is transitory.

Going forward, the more favourable global growth prospects will lead to sustained export performance and generate positive spillovers to the domestic economy. Private consumption will be underpinned by higher wages and employment. The improved investment outlook is being driven by new and ongoing infrastructure projects, and stronger capacity expansion in the manufacturing and services sectors. Overall, the economy is expected to register higher growth in 2017. Headline inflation moderated to 3.9% in May, due mainly to the decline in domestic fuel prices during the month. Headline inflation is expected to moderate in the second half of the year mainly reflecting the waning effect of global cost factors. Underlying inflation, as measured by core inflation, will be sustained by the more robust domestic demand but is expected to remain contained. The domestic financial markets have been resilient. The ringgit has remained stable with a more balanced demand and supply of foreign currencies following the implementation of the two financial market development measures. Banking system liquidity remains sufficient with financial institutions continuing to operate with strong capital and liquidity buffers. The growth of financing to the private sector has improved, consistent with the pace of economic activity. At the current level of the OPR, the stance of monetary policy is accommodative and supportive of economic activity. The MPC will continue to assess the balance of risks surrounding the outlook for domestic growth and inflation.",2017,Q3-2017,decide maintain overnight rate opr global economy continue strengthen growth synchronise country industrial activity global trade eceeding earlier projection advanced economy broadbased increase investment amid steady growth consumption raise growth prospect asia growth epected driven domestic activity strong eternal demand risk global growth outlook arise political uncertainty major economy geopolitical financial market development volatility commodity price malaysian economy perform epected growth lift strong domestic demand additional impetus eports forward favourable global growth prospect lead sustain eport performance generate positive spillover domestic economy private consumption underpinned high wage employment improve investment outlook driven ongoing infrastructure project strong capacity epansion manufacturing service sector economy epected register high growth headline inflation moderate due decline domestic fuel price headline inflation epected moderate half reflect wan effect global cost factor underlie inflation measure core inflation sustain robust domestic demand epected remain domestic financial market resilient ringgit remain stable balance demand supply foreign currency implementation financial market development measure banking system liquidity remains sufficient financial institution continue operate strong capital liquidity buffer growth financing private sector improve consistent pace economic activity current level opr stance accommodative supportive economic activity continue ass balance risk surround outlook domestic growth inflation decide maintain overnight rate opr global economy continue strengthen growth synchronise country industrial activity global trade eceeding earlier projection advanced economy broadbased increase investment amid steady growth consumption raise growth prospect asia growth epected driven domestic activity strong eternal demand risk global growth outlook arise political uncertainty major economy geopolitical financial market development volatility commodity price malaysian economy perform epected growth lift strong domestic demand additional impetus eports forward favourable global growth prospect lead sustain eport performance generate positive spillover domestic economy private consumption underpinned high wage employment improve investment outlook driven ongoing infrastructure project strong capacity epansion manufacturing service sector economy epected register high growth headline inflation moderate due decline domestic fuel price headline inflation epected moderate half reflect wan effect global cost factor underlie inflation measure core inflation sustain robust domestic demand epected remain domestic financial market resilient ringgit remain stable balance demand supply foreign currency implementation financial market development measure banking system liquidity remains sufficient financial institution continue operate strong capital liquidity buffer growth financing private sector improve consistent pace economic activity current level opr stance accommodative supportive economic activity continue ass balance risk surround outlook domestic growth inflation,100.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6296296296296297

Indicators suggest that the outlook for the global economy will continue to improve. In the advanced economies, the revival in investment is expected to provide additional impetus to economic activity. In the emerging economies, growth is projected to be supported by sustained domestic activity and stronger external demand. Nevertheless, there remain risks to global growth arising from threats such as protectionism, geopolitical developments, and commodity price volatility. These risks could also reignite financial market volatility.For Malaysia, the growth momentum since the second half of 2016 is expected to strengthen in the first quarter of 2017, and to be sustained for the rest of the year. Growth will be mainly driven by domestic demand amid continued wage and employment growth, and the implementation of new and on-going investment projects. On the external front, given the improvement in global growth, exports are expected to perform more strongly and contribute positively to Malaysia’s economic performance.Headline inflation increased to 4.3% in the first quarter of the year, in line with the MPC’s expectations. The increase in inflation reflected mainly the pass-through impact of higher global oil prices and temporary supply disruptions that led to higher food prices. The higher headline inflation is expected to moderate in the second half of the year. However, the trend of domestic headline inflation will be dependent on future global oil prices which remain highly uncertain.

28,7-Sep-16,0,3.0,"At the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) meeting today, Bank Negara Malaysia decided to maintain the Overnight Policy Rate (OPR) at 3.00 percent.The global economy continues to expand at a moderate pace. Growth across the advanced economies has been modest. In Asia, economic activity has been supported by domestic demand amid weaker export growth. While volatility in the international financial markets has subsided, markets remain vulnerable to setbacks and changes in sentiments. Going forward, downside risks to global growth remain high following uncertainty over the growth momentum and policy shifts in major economies, and unresolved issues post the EU referendum in the United Kingdom.For Malaysia, growth moderated slightly in the second quarter of the year, following weaker net exports and a drawdown in stocks. Domestic demand, however, remained the key driver of growth, with private consumption and private investment growing at a faster pace. Going forward, private consumption will remain supported by wage and employment growth, with additional impetus coming from announced Government measures to increase disposable income. Investment activity will continue to be anchored by the on-going implementation of infrastructure projects and capital spending in the manufacturing and services sectors.

Overall, the economy is projected to expand within expectations in 2016, and to remain on a steady growth path in 2017.Headline inflation moderated to 1.1% in July. Inflation is expected to be at the lower end of the 2 to 3% range for 2016 and to remain relatively stable in 2017 given the environment of low global energy and commodity prices, and generally subdued global inflation.Domestic financial conditions have remained stable since the previous MPC meeting with financial markets continuing to function in an orderly manner.

Going forward, downside risks to global growth remain high arising from the moderating growth momentum in a number of major economies, uncertainty surrounding energy and commodity prices and possible disorderly market conditions arising from policy shifts in major economies.The performance of the Malaysian economy continues to be affected by the weak external environment.  Domestic demand therefore remains the main driver of growth. Private consumption is, however, expected to moderate as households continue adjusting to the higher cost of living amidst an uncertain economic environment. Household spending will nevertheless be supported by wage growth and stable labour market conditions. Despite the slowing investment activity in the oil and gas industry, investment is being supported by infrastructure development projects and capital spending by the manufacturing and services sectors.Looking ahead, domestic demand will continue to be the key driver of growth, with an additional lift from exports as global growth improves.  The Malaysian economy will continue to benefit from having diversified sources of growth, economic flexibility, low unemployment, manageable level of external debt and a well-capitalised banking system. The prospects are for the economy to expand within the region of 4.5 to 5.5 percent this year and 4 to 5 percent in 2016.  It is, however, recognised that the downside risks to growth remain high.Headline inflation averaged at 2.8% in August and September, and is expected to remain relatively stable for the rest of 2015. Despite the weaker ringgit exchange rate, the impact on overall inflation has been limited by the lower commodity prices and the generally low global inflation. For 2016, headline inflation is expected to be higher, to peak in the first quarter and moderating thereafter.Global and domestic developments have continued to affect the ringgit exchange rate and domestic financial markets. In this environment, however, domestic liquidity continues to be sufficient and the financial system remains sound with healthy growth in financing. Financial intermediation has therefore continued to support the economy.  Bank Negara Malaysia will continue to ensure the orderly functioning of the money and foreign exchange markets.At the current level of the OPR, the stance of monetary policy remains accommodative and supportive of economic activity. The MPC recognises that there are heightened risks in the global economic and financial environment. These risks are being carefully monitored to assess their implications on macroeconomic stability and the prospects of the Malaysian economy. This is to ensure that the monetary policy stance is consistent with the sustainability of the overall growth prospects.The meeting also approved the schedule of MPC meetings for 2016. In accordance with the Central Bank of Malaysia Act 2009, the MPC will convene six times during the year. The meetings will be held over two days, with the Monetary Policy Statement released at 6 p.m. on the second day of the MPC meeting.Schedule of Monetary Policy Committee Meetings for 2016MPC Meeting No.Dates1st20 and 21 January 2016 (Wednesday and Thursday)2nd8 and 9 March 2016 (Tuesday and Wednesday)3rd18 and 19 May 2016 (Wednesday and Thursday)4th12 and 13 July 2016 (Tuesday and Wednesday)5th6 and 7 September 2016 (Tuesday and Wednesday)6th22 and 23 November 2016 (Tuesday and Wednesday) At the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) meeting today, Bank Negara Malaysia decided to maintain the Overnight Policy Rate (OPR) at 3.25 percent.

Although growth across the advanced economies has improved, it has remained modest. In most of Asia, while there has been a moderation in growth, domestic demand continues to support economic activity. Looking ahead, while the global economic recovery is expected to continue, the downside risks to growth have increased arising from the moderating growth momentum in the major emerging market economies, uncertainty in commodity prices and the heightened volatility in financial markets.For Malaysia, recent indicators suggest continued expansion in economic activity in the third quarter despite ongoing adjustments to external and domestic developments. Private consumption is expected to moderate as households continue to adjust to the implementation of the Goods and Services Tax (GST) and the more uncertain economic environment. Household spending will however be supported by wage growth and stable labour market conditions. Investment activity is projected to be led by capital spending in the manufacturing and services sectors, and ongoing infrastructure projects. The continued expansion in domestic demand is expected to contribute towards mitigating the weak performance of the external sector. Going forward, downside risks to growth, however, have risen amid greater uncertainty on both the global and domestic fronts. Of significance, Malaysia is entering this challenging period from a position of strength given the diversified sources of growth of the economy, low unemployment level, manageable level of external indebtedness, and a well-capitalised banking system. The assessment is therefore for the economic growth to remain within the region of 4.5 to 5.5 percent.Headline inflation averaged at 2.9% in June and July reflecting higher domestic fuel prices and the impact of the GST. Despite the weaker ringgit exchange rate, the impact on overall inflation has been limited by the lower commodity prices and the generally low global inflation.

The financial system remains sound, with healthy growth in financing. Financial intermediation has therefore continued to support the economy.The ringgit exchange rate is being affected by global factors that are affecting many emerging and commodity producing economies. These factors include the weaker commodity prices, the strength of the U.S. dollar, and the uncertainty in the global financial markets.

While growth across the advanced economies has improved, it has remained modest. In most of Asia, domestic demand continues to support growth despite weaker exports. Looking ahead, the recovery in global growth performance has, however, become vulnerable to increased downside risks. International financial markets have also become more volatile following increased concerns over developments in Europe and continued policy uncertainties in several major advanced countries.  There are also downside risks to growth in the major Asian economies.For Malaysia, the latest indicators point to continued expansion of the economy in the second quarter, albeit at a more moderate pace. Overall growth continues to be underpinned by domestic demand. Growth in private consumption is expected to be slower following the frontloading of consumption activity prior to the implementation of the Goods and Services Tax (GST) in the first quarter. While households are expected to continue adjusting to the GST in the immediate future, overall spending will be supported by continued wage growth and stable labour market conditions. Investment activity is projected to be driven by capital spending in the manufacturing and services sectors, as well as for infrastructure projects. These developments will contribute towards offsetting the weaker performance of the external sector. On balance, the prospects are for the Malaysian economy to remain on a steady growth path, with domestic demand being the key driver of growth.Headline inflation averaged at 2% in April and May. Going forward, headline inflation is expected to be higher following the impact of the GST and the recent adjustments to domestic fuel prices, before moderating towards the second half of 2016. Nevertheless, underlying inflation is expected to remain contained amid stable domestic demand conditions.While recent global and domestic developments have affected the ringgit exchange rate and domestic financial markets, there remains ample liquidity in the domestic financial system with continued orderly functioning of the financial and foreign exchange markets.

36,7-May-15,0,3.25,"At the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) meeting today, Bank Negara Malaysia decided to maintain the Overnight Policy Rate (OPR) at 3.25 percent.The global economic expansion remains moderate, with divergent growth momentum across economies in the first quarter of 2015. While there have been improvements in the advanced economies, the pace of recovery has continued at a modest and uneven pace. For the emerging economies, while growth is slower, the economies continue to be the key contributor to global growth. In most of Asia, growth has been sustained by the continued expansion in domestic demand. Going forward, global economic growth is expected to improve although at a moderate pace. Downside risks to this outlook, however, continue to persist. In this environment, the international financial markets will continue to be affected by shifts in global liquidity and investors sentiments.For Malaysia, latest indicators suggest that domestic demand has continued to support growth in the first quarter. Looking ahead, the prospects are for the Malaysian economy to remain on a steady growth path, with domestic demand remaining as the key driver of growth. Although private consumption is expected to moderate as households adjust to the introduction of the Goods and Services Tax (GST), consumption expenditure will be supported by the steady rise in incomes and employment. Investment activity is expected to be led by capital spending in the export-oriented industries, the services sector and for infrastructure projects. These investments will cushion the impact of the lower oil and gas-related investment activity. On the external front, while export growth will be affected by lower commodity prices, manufactured exports will continue to benefit from the improvement in economic activity in several advanced economies and the sustained growth in Asia.Headline inflation averaged at 0.7% in the first quarter of 2015 due to lower domestic fuel prices. For the rest of the year, headline inflation is expected to trend higher given the impact of the implementation of the GST. This is expected to be partially offset by the overall lower global commodity and energy prices. Underlying inflation is expected to remain contained amid the stable domestic demand conditions.At the current level of the OPR, the stance of monetary policy remains accommodative and supportive of economic activity. The MPC will continue to carefully assess external and domestic developments and their implications on the risks to inflation and the Malaysian economy.

37,5-Mar-15,0,3.25,"At the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) meeting today, Bank Negara Malaysia decided to maintain the Overnight Policy Rate (OPR) at 3.25 percent.While the global economy continues to expand at a moderate pace, there has been increasing divergence in the growth momentum among the major economies. For most of Asia, growth is supported by the continued expansion of domestic demand. Looking ahead, the global economy is expected to continue on a moderate recovery path. Nevertheless, the downside risks to the global economic outlook remain given the weak growth momentum in a number of major economies. The uncertainties in the policy environment are also contributing to the shift in sentiments in the international financial markets.While the Malaysian financial markets have been affected by these global developments, there remains ample liquidity in the domestic financial system with continued orderly functioning of the financial markets. The banking institutions are also operating with strong capital and liquidity buffers, and continue to provide financing to the economy. There has, therefore, been no disruption to financial intermediation.In the Malaysian economy, domestic demand has continued to support growth amid a moderation in exports in the fourth quarter of 2014. Going forward, domestic demand will remain as a key driver of growth. While the introduction of the Goods and Services Tax and the lower earnings in the commodity sector are expected to have some impact on private consumption, household spending will continue to be supported by the steady increase in income and employment. Additionally, the lower fuel prices are contributing to higher disposable income. Investment activity is also expected to remain resilient, with broad-based capital spending by both the private and public sectors, thus cushioning the lower investment in the oil and gas sector. While export growth will be affected by the lower commodity prices, the performance of manufactured exports is expected to improve. The prospects are therefore for the Malaysian economy to still remain on a steady growth path.Headline inflation declined in January and is expected to remain low in the first quarter of 2015. For the rest of the year, headline inflation is expected to trend higher, but to be below its historical average. The lower fuel prices will partially offset other domestic cost factors. While the monthly headline inflation would be subjected to the volatility in global oil prices, underlying inflation is expected to remain contained amid the stable domestic demand conditions.At the current level of the OPR, the stance of monetary policy remains accommodative and supportive of economic activity. The MPC will continue to carefully assess external and domestic developments and their implications on the risks to inflation and on the Malaysian economy. The MPC will also continue to monitor the risks of destabilising financial imbalances to ensure the sustainability of the overall growth prospects. At the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) meeting today, Bank Negara Malaysia decided to maintain the Overnight Policy Rate (OPR) at 3.25 percent. While the global economy continues to expand at a moderate pace, there has been increasing divergence in the growth momentum among the major economies. For most of Asia, growth is supported by the continued expansion of domestic demand. Looking ahead, the global economy is expected to continue on a moderate recovery path. Nevertheless, the downside risks to the global economic outlook remain given the weak growth momentum in a number of major economies. The uncertainties in the policy environment are also contributing to the shift in sentiments in the international financial markets. While the Malaysian financial markets have been affected by these global developments, there remains ample liquidity in the domestic financial system with continued orderly functioning of the financial markets. The banking institutions are also operating with strong capital and liquidity buffers, and continue to provide financing to the economy. There has, therefore, been no disruption to financial intermediation. In the Malaysian economy, domestic demand has continued to support growth amid a moderation in exports in the fourth quarter of 2014. Going forward, domestic demand will remain as a key driver of growth. While the introduction of the Goods and Services Tax and the lower earnings in the commodity sector are expected to have some impact on private consumption, household spending will continue to be supported by the steady increase in income and employment. Additionally, the lower fuel prices are contributing to higher disposable income. Investment activity is also expected to remain resilient, with broad-based capital spending by both the private and public sectors, thus cushioning the lower investment in the oil and gas sector. While export growth will be affected by the lower commodity prices, the performance of manufactured exports is expected to improve. The prospects are therefore for the Malaysian economy to still remain on a steady growth path. Headline inflation declined in January and is expected to remain low in the first quarter of 2015. For the rest of the year, headline inflation is expected to trend higher, but to be below its historical average. The lower fuel prices will partially offset other domestic cost factors. While the monthly headline inflation would be subjected to the volatility in global oil prices, underlying inflation is expected to remain contained amid the stable domestic demand conditions.

For most of Asia, growth is supported by the continued expansion in both domestic and external demand.

Nevertheless, the downside risk to the global economic outlook has increased following the weakening growth momentum in a number of major economies due to external and domestic specific factors.Volatility in the international financial markets has increased amid shifts in global liquidity and heightened uncertainty particularly with regard to global growth prospects and the decline in commodity prices.

Conditions in the international financial markets continue to be volatile as markets adjust to policy shifts in a number of major economies and to geopolitical developments.For the Malaysian economy, latest indicators point to further improvement in exports and continued expansion in private sector investment spending.

56,31-Jan-12,0,3.0,"At the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) meeting today, Bank Negara Malaysia decided to maintain the Overnight Policy Rate (OPR) at 3.00 percent.In the recent months, global economic and financial conditions have deteriorated following the escalation of the sovereign debt crisis in Europe, the ongoing fiscal consolidation and the significant policy uncertainties. Heightened market volatility, impaired financial intermediation and weak labour market conditions continue to weigh down on growth in the advanced economies. These conditions pose downside risks to global growth. In Asia, while growth continues to be supported by sustained domestic demand, the growth momentum has moderated amid the weaker external environment.In the domestic economy, the latest indicators point towards continued expansion in the fourth quarter of 2011. Growth was driven by sustained domestic consumption and investment activities, while the external sector showed signs of moderation. Looking ahead, the economy is expected to continue to expand, underpinned by sustained private sector economic activity and further reinforced by public sector spending. Employment conditions are expected to remain stable while the outlook for domestic-oriented sectors continues to be favourable. Overall growth prospects, however, would be affected by the slowdown in external demand, resulting in slower growth in exports and industrial production.Domestic headline inflation averaged 3.2% in 2011. Going into 2012, the assessment is that cost-push inflation will moderate as slowing global economic activity will alleviate the pressure on the prices of key commodities. The impact of domestic demand factors on inflation is expected to be contained, in line with stable domestic demand conditions. Headline inflation, therefore, is expected to moderate in 2012. Nevertheless, risks to inflation could emerge arising from supply disruptions that would result in higher food and commodity prices.In the MPC's assessment, the global environment will become more challenging going forward. As Malaysia's economic growth and inflation prospects will be affected by these external developments, the MPC will continue to assess carefully the risks to domestic growth and inflation. At the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) meeting today, Bank Negara Malaysia decided to maintain the Overnight Policy Rate (OPR) at 3.00 percent.In the recent months, global economic and financial conditions have deteriorated following the escalation of the sovereign debt crisis in Europe, the ongoing fiscal consolidation and the significant policy uncertainties. Heightened market volatility, impaired financial intermediation and weak labour market conditions continue to weigh down on growth in the advanced economies. These conditions pose downside risks to global growth. In Asia, while growth continues to be supported by sustained domestic demand, the growth momentum has moderated amid the weaker external environment. In the domestic economy, the latest indicators point towards continued expansion in the fourth quarter of 2011. Growth was driven by sustained domestic consumption and investment activities, while the external sector showed signs of moderation. Looking ahead, the economy is expected to continue to expand, underpinned by sustained private sector economic activity and further reinforced by public sector spending. Employment conditions are expected to remain stable while the outlook for domestic-oriented sectors continues to be favourable. Overall growth prospects, however, would be affected by the slowdown in external demand, resulting in slower growth in exports and industrial production. Domestic headline inflation averaged 3.2% in 2011. Going into 2012, the assessment is that cost-push inflation will moderate as slowing global economic activity will alleviate the pressure on the prices of key commodities.

For the region, growth is expected to be sustained by robust domestic demand, increased investment activity and intra-regional trade.In the domestic economy, the latest indicators point to a moderation in growth in the second quarter, due primarily to slower external demand, greater than expected disruptions in the global manufacturing supply chain and lower than projected public sector investment.

62,27-Jan-11,0,2.75,"At the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) meeting today, Bank Negara Malaysia decided to maintain the Overnight Policy Rate (OPR) at 2.75 percent.The recovery of the global economy is continuing, although the growth performance differs markedly across regions.  While the advanced economies continue to register modest growth, most emerging economies have experienced strong growth.  For the Asian region, while growth has moderated amid weaker external demand, domestic economic activity continues to provide strong support to the growth momentum. However, shifts in global liquidity have resulted in significant capital flows into the emerging economies, in particular, into the Asian region, and have brought with it risks to macroeconomic and financial stability. The region is also being affected by global inflationary pressures arising from the higher commodity and food prices.In the domestic economy, recent indicators point towards a sustained expansion in private sector activity in the fourth quarter of 2010. External demand, however, was affected by the slower global growth. Going forward, the Malaysian economy is expected to grow at a steady pace in 2011, underpinned by continued firm expansion in domestic demand amid more moderate external demand. Private consumption will be supported by sustained employment and income growth, while the favourable outlook in the domestic-oriented sectors and the expansion of new growth industries will provide support for continued private investment activity.While domestic headline inflation rose towards the end of 2010, it has remained low at 2.2%. The increase was mainly on account of higher food and energy prices. Prices are expected to increase at a modest pace in the coming months, driven primarily by rising global commodity and food prices.  The assessment is that inflation will continue to be driven by supply factors with limited evidence of excess demand exerting pressure on prices.At this stage, the MPC considers the current monetary policy stance as appropriate and consistent with the current assessment of the economic growth and inflation prospects. The stance of monetary policy continues to remain accommodative and supportive of economic growth. However, the large and volatile shifts in global liquidity are leading to a build up of liquidity in the domestic financial system.  While the liquidity in the financial system has been manageable, going forward, additional policy tools such as the statutory reserve requirement and macroprudential lending measures may be considered to avoid the risks of macroeconomic and financial imbalances.

Nevertheless, domestic demand has provided strong support to growth. Going forward, overall growth will continue to be well supported by domestic economic activity. Private consumption will benefit from the favourable employment conditions, firm commodity prices and accommodative financing environment, while the expansion in private investment is expected to be driven by increased capital spending in the domestic-oriented sectors.Domestic headline inflation moderated in September to 1.8%.

64,2-Sep-10,0,2.75,"At the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) meeting today, Bank Negara Malaysia decided to maintain the Overnight Policy Rate (OPR) at 2.75 percent.The global growth momentum has moderated in recent months. In the advanced economies, growth has slowed by more than expected following continued weakness in the labour market and the fading impact of the temporary boost to economic activity provided by the inventory build up and the policy stimulus. For the regional economies, after registering strong economic expansion in the first half of the year, the slower pace of export growth will have some impact on economic performance. Domestic economic activity, however, remains strong. Given these developments, the assessment going forward is for the global recovery to proceed at a more moderate pace.The Malaysian economy expanded strongly in the first half of this year, underpinned by strengthening domestic demand, particularly in the private sector. As in other regional countries, Malaysia's export growth has, however, slowed in recent months. These conditions are expected to continue with the slowing of global growth. While these external developments may result in a moderation in the pace of growth of the Malaysian economy, moving forward, the overall growth will continue to be supported by the robust domestic economic activity. Leading indicators suggest that private consumption and private investment will continue to expand. This is also supported by the favourable labour market conditions, positive consumer and business sentiments, low inflation and conducive credit conditions.Domestic inflation edged higher in June and July mainly on account of increases in food and energy prices. Despite the adjustment in retail fuel prices in July, inflation is expected to rise at a modest pace in the coming months. Going into 2011, inflation is projected to continue to remain moderate.The MPC considers the current monetary policy as appropriate and consistent with the latest assessment of the economic growth and inflation prospects.

68,26-Jan-10,0,2.0,"At the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) meeting today, Bank Negara Malaysia decided to leave the Overnight Policy Rate (OPR) unchanged at 2.00 percent.The recovery in the global economy continues to gather pace, supported by continued expansionary economic policies, improved financial conditions and a strong rebound in several emerging economies. While the growth momentum in regional economies is expected to strengthen further in 2010, there remains uncertainty on the prospects for the advanced economies as growth continues to depend on policy stimulus measures, and the sustainability of private sector demand amid ongoing financial system resolution and reforms.In the domestic economy, recent economic indicators suggest that the economy expanded favourably in the fourth quarter of 2009. Positive developments in manufacturing production, financing activity, external trade and labour market conditions reaffirm the assessment that the economic recovery is gaining strength. Going forward, the economy is expected to expand further in 2010, with growth being supported by strengthening domestic demand, particularly private consumption, and further improvements in external demand.Inflation turned positive in December. The change largely reflects the lapse of the impact from the adjustment to retail fuel prices in 2008. The pace of price increase for the year is projected to be gradual, reflecting the prevailing economic conditions and taking into account some adjustments in administered prices. In the absence of further price revisions and external influences, a positive but modest inflation rate is expected in 2010.Moving forward, monetary policy would remain accommodative to ensure that the economic recovery is well entrenched. At the same time, the MPC also recognizes the need to ensure that the stance of monetary policy is appropriate to prevent the build up of financial imbalances that could arise from interest rates being too low for a prolonged period of time.

Economic activity in the advanced economies has shown broader signs of recovery, supported by the impact of the policy measures, while several regional economies have recorded positive growth in the third quarter. While these positive developments are expected to continue going into 2010, the recovery is likely to be gradual and uneven, with the outlook remaining uncertain once the effects of the policy support begin to diminish.In the domestic economy, the pace of recovery is gaining momentum.  Going forward, domestic demand, particularly private consumption and public sector spending, will continue to provide support for growth.   This is supported by the sustained implementation of fiscal measures, accommodative monetary policy and continued access to financing.Inflation continued to decline at a slower rate in October. The slower decline largely reflects the cumulative fall in retail fuel prices since June 2008 and the reduced pressure on food prices.

In the absence of further unanticipated price adjustments and external influences, inflation is expected to remain modest in 2010.With improving domestic economic conditions and as price pressures and inflation expectations are expected to remain contained going forward, the assessment is that the current monetary policy stance is appropriate and will continue to provide support for economic activity.The meeting also approved the schedule of MPC meetings for 2010.

Economic activity in the advanced economies has shown broader signs of stabilisation, supported by the impact of policy measures implemented and an improvement in consumer sentiment and business confidence. Several regional economies have reported positive growth in the third quarter, indicating that recovery in the region is ongoing. Notwithstanding these improvements, the outlook for the global economy continues to be uncertain, with recovery likely to be slow and uneven in view of the ongoing adjustments.In the domestic economy, stronger evidence has emerged to suggest that conditions are improving and a recovery in economic activity is gaining some strength. These improvements are more broad-based and are reflected in stronger labour market conditions, consumer and business sentiments, industrial production, financing activity and external trade. These positive developments are expected to continue into 2010, with growth in the domestic economy expected to continue to be supported by existing policy measures and the growing confidence in the private sector.Consumer prices declined at a slower rate in September. The decline in prices largely reflects the cumulative fall in fuel prices since June 2008 and the easing pressure on food prices. The decline in consumer prices, however, is expected to be temporary. Excluding further unanticipated price adjustments and external influences, inflation in 2010 is projected to be positive but remain subdued.With improving domestic economic conditions, and as price pressures and inflationary expectations are expected to remain contained going forward, the assessment is that the current monetary policy stance is appropriate and will continue to provide support to economic activity.

In the advanced economies, while the overall economic conditions continue to remain weak, the pace of decline in economic activity is slowing. There is also evidence of improvements in economic activity in most regional economies. Measures to stabilise the financial systems in the advanced countries, combined with the cumulative effects of fiscal and monetary stimulus, have continued to contribute towards a gradual improvement in economic activity in most countries.Conditions in the domestic economy have also shown signs of stabilising in the second quarter, with several indicators such as the industrial production index and retrenchments recording a slower pace of decline. Going forward, improvements in labour market conditions and business and consumer sentiments will provide support to domestic demand. In addition, the accelerated implementation of the fiscal stimulus, the continued access to financing and the lower rate of inflation will also contribute to the improvement in the domestic economy in the second half of 2009 and into 2010.In accordance with expectations, inflation continued to moderate and turned negative in June. The decline in inflation is largely a statistical outcome reflecting the sharp rise in inflation in June 2008, when fuel prices increased following the reduction in fuel subsidies. The negative inflation is expected to be temporary and is projected to turn positive as domestic economic conditions improve.The assessment is that with the current low interest rates and with the fiscal stimulus gaining traction, the prevailing policy measures are sufficient to provide support to economic activity.

While certain segments of the international financial markets have stabilised, and further progress has been achieved in the financial sector resolution, the spillover effects have led to a severe contraction in economic activity in the advanced economies.The full effect of these global developments is being felt by the regional economies during the first half of 2009.The domestic economy continues to be adversely affected by the significant contraction in external demand, resulting in steep declines in exports and industrial production. This has resulted in a marked contraction in the Malaysian economy in the first quarter of 2009. These conditions have continued into the second quarter. However, a more modest pace of decline in the latest indicators of global economic activity suggest the potential for a gradual improvement in the second half of the year. This stabilisation in the external environment is also supported by the accelerated implementation of fiscal measures, the further moderation in inflation and continued access to financing, thereby increasing the prospects for a resumption of growth in the Malaysian economy.The current assessment is that the accumulated monetary policy initiatives and measures to enhance access to financing are sufficient to provide support to domestic demand.

74,29-Apr-09,0,2.0,"At the Monetary Policy Committee meeting today, Bank Negara Malaysia decided to leave the Overnight Policy Rate (OPR) unchanged at 2.00 percent.The global economic conditions deteriorated further in the first quarter of 2009, while conditions in the international financial system have yet to normalise. Although there are tentative signs of a slower pace of decline in a number of economic indicators in recent months, major advanced economies are still experiencing a deepening economic contraction. Regional economies have also recorded a sharp economic slowdown in the first quarter. While the near-term economic outlook will continue to remain weak, the implementation of large stimulus measures by several countries has increased the prospects for economic conditions to improve in the second half of the year. Further progress in the financial sector resolution has also been made in several advanced economies, the success of which is a key precondition for the stabilisation of economic and financial conditions.The sharply adverse global developments have resulted in steep declines in Malaysia's exports and industrial production, which have in turn affected private sector activity and labour market conditions. The economy, therefore, is expected to record a marked contraction in the first quarter of 2009. These conditions are expected to prevail until the second quarter of the year. Nevertheless, some signs of moderation in the pace of decline in economic activity have emerged. The current assessment is that the domestic economy is expected to improve in the second half of 2009, supported by stabilisation in global economic conditions and the larger impetus from the implementation of the fiscal stimulus measures.Meanwhile, inflation decelerated to 3.5 percent in March, and is expected to moderate further amid subdued demand conditions and lower external price pressures.Going forward, the implementation of the fiscal stimulus measures, and the accommodative monetary environment following the previous reductions in the OPR, will provide support to domestic economic activity. The Malaysian financial system remains strong and the monetary transmission process is functioning to deliver the impact of the policy stimulus to the economy. An acceleration of the implementation of the fiscal measures would raise the prospects for an earlier resumption of positive growth in the Malaysian economy. The current assessment is that the accumulated monetary policy measures are sufficient to provide support to domestic demand. Continued attention will be given to ensure an adequate flow of credit to all segments of the economy. In addition, access to the bond market by the private sector will be further enhanced by the establishment of the Financial Guarantee Institution. Liquidity in the financial system remains sufficient to support the demand for financing from both the private and public sectors.Bank Negara Malaysia will monitor closely and assess the evolving developments in setting future monetary and financial policies.

79,25-Aug-08,0,3.5,"At the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) meeting today, Bank Negara Malaysia decided to leave the Overnight Policy Rate (OPR) unchanged at 3.50 percent.Since the previous MPC meeting, the global economy has weakened further with growing evidence of a deterioration of economic performance across a number of the developed economies. This has been the outcome of financial stress, tight credit conditions, asset market weakness and the impact of higher energy and commodity prices. There are also now signs of moderating growth in several emerging economies.The Malaysian economy has been affected by these developments. Although the export sector has benefited from the high energy and commodity prices, the slower global growth is expected to exert a moderating impact on exports. In addition, domestic demand is being affected by the deflationary impact of higher energy and food prices, the softening labour market conditions, and the more challenging business environment.Domestic inflation is expected to remain high for the remaining part of 2008 and going into early 2009, primarily reflecting the first-round effects of the adjustments in energy prices, and the higher commodity and food prices. Indicators such as the Producer Price Index continue to show that businesses are still facing rising operating costs. However, competitive pressures and slowing demand are likely to contain the pass-through to consumer prices. The recent decline in commodity prices is also likely to ease these cost pressures. Overall, the weaker economic conditions will reduce the likelihood of second-round effects that will generate persistent inflationary trends. The assessment is therefore that inflation is expected to moderate substantially in the second-half of 2009.Consequently, the Bank maintains the assessment that with the expected moderation in inflation in the medium term, the greater priority is to avoid a fundamental downturn in economic activity. The current level of the OPR is consistent with this outlook. Going forward, the Bank will maintain its focus on the medium term outlook for inflation and growth, and will carefully assess global and domestic developments in setting the stance of monetary policy.

80,25-Jul-08,0,3.5,"While the Malaysian economy has performed well in the first-half of the year, in the next twelve months, it is expected to experience a more challenging environment in which both the risks to higher inflation and slower growth have increased considerably. The assessment is for a slower global growth with a more protracted and significant slowdown in a number of the developed economies and some moderation in growth in the emerging economies. At the same time, commodity and energy prices are expected to remain at elevated levels, thus fuelling inflation in the global economy.The performance of the Malaysian economy in the first-half of 2008 has been driven by robust domestic demand and reinforced by favourable export performance. The recent major restructuring of domestic energy prices to bring prices closer to the substantially higher international prices is intended to reduce the fundamental distortions that it might create, and to ensure fiscal sustainability. These adjustments are expected to have a deflationary effect on the economy in the second half of this year and into the early part of 2009.The adjustments to the higher international energy and commodity prices have translated into higher domestic consumer prices. In June, consumer price inflation increased by 7.7%, of which about 41% of the increase in inflation was due to the increase in transportation costs while another 41% of the increase has been due to higher prices for food and non-alcoholic beverages.The Bank is projecting inflation to remain elevated in the second-half of this year and into early next year before moderating towards the middle of 2009. The average inflation for 2008 is projected to be in the range of 5.5-6.0%. The inflation rate is expected to moderate in the second half of 2009 in the context of a more moderate growth environment. Currently, much of the significant rise in inflation is due to the increase in fuel prices. At this stage, the concern is for broader price increases and second-round effects, which would result in inflation being persistent. In such circumstances, the appropriate monetary policy response will be taken in order to maintain medium term price stability and ensure that the high inflation does not undermine the longer term growth prospects of the Malaysian economy.In the next twelve months, while both the risks to higher inflation and the risks to slower growth have increased, the immediate concern is to avoid a fundamental economic slowdown that would involve higher unemployment. Slowing growth itself will contribute to containing the potential for second round effects on inflation, thereby containing further increases in prices in the second-half of 2009. Given the underlying fundamental strength of the economy, and the resilient banking sector, the Bank’s assessment is that after this transitional period, the Malaysian economy has the potential to reestablish its medium term growth path.Based on this assessment, the Monetary Policy Committee has decided to keep the Overnight Policy Rate unchanged at 3.50%. While the Malaysian economy has performed well in the first-half of the year, in the next twelve months, it is expected to experience a more challenging environment in which both the risks to higher inflation and slower growth have increased considerably. The assessment is for a slower global growth with a more protracted and significant slowdown in a number of the developed economies and some moderation in growth in the emerging economies. At the same time, commodity and energy prices are expected to remain at elevated levels, thus fuelling inflation in the global economy.The performance of the Malaysian economy in the first-half of 2008 has been driven by robust domestic demand and reinforced by favourable export performance. The recent major restructuring of domestic energy prices to bring prices closer to the substantially higher international prices is intended to reduce the fundamental distortions that it might create, and to ensure fiscal sustainability. These adjustments are expected to have a deflationary effect on the economy in the second half of this year and into the early part of 2009.The adjustments to the higher international energy and commodity prices have translated into higher domestic consumer prices. In June, consumer price inflation increased by 7.7%, of which about 41% of the increase in inflation was due to the increase in transportation costs while another 41% of the increase has been due to higher prices for food and non-alcoholic beverages.The Bank is projecting inflation to remain elevated in the second-half of this year and into early next year before moderating towards the middle of 2009. The average inflation for 2008 is projected to be in the range of 5.5-6.0%. The inflation rate is expected to moderate in the second half of 2009 in the context of a more moderate growth environment. Currently, much of the significant rise in inflation is due to the increase in fuel prices. At this stage, the concern is for broader price increases and second-round effects, which would result in inflation being persistent. In such circumstances, the appropriate monetary policy response will be taken in order to maintain medium term price stability and ensure that the high inflation does not undermine the longer term growth prospects of the Malaysian economy.In the next twelve months, while both the risks to higher inflation and the risks to slower growth have increased, the immediate concern is to avoid a fundamental economic slowdown that would involve higher unemployment. Slowing growth itself will contribute to containing the potential for second round effects on inflation, thereby containing further increases in prices in the second-half of 2009. Given the underlying fundamental strength of the economy, and the resilient banking sector, the Bank’s assessment is that after this transitional period, the Malaysian economy has the potential to reestablish its medium term growth path.Based on this assessment, the Monetary Policy Committee has decided to keep the Overnight Policy Rate unchanged at 3.50%.",2008,Q3-2008,malaysian economy perform firsthalf net epected eperience challenge environment risk high inflation slow growth increase considerably assessment slow global growth protract significant slowdown number developed economy moderation growth emerge economy time commodity energy price epected remain elevate level fuel inflation global economy performance malaysian economy firsthalf driven robust domestic demand reinforce favourable eport performance recent major restructuring domestic energy price bring price closer substantially high international price intend reduce fundamental distortion create ensure fiscal sustainability adjustment epected deflationary effect economy half early part adjustment high international energy commodity price translate high domestic consumer price consumer price inflation increase increase inflation due increase transportation cost increase due high price food nonalcoholic beverage project inflation remain elevate secondhalf early net moderate middle average inflation project range inflation rate epected moderate half contet moderate growth environment significant rise inflation due increase fuel price stage concern broader price increase secondround effect result inflation persistent circumstance response order maintain medium term price stability ensure high inflation undermine longer term growth prospect malaysian economy net risk high inflation risk slow growth increase concern avoid fundamental economic slowdown involve high unemployment slow growth contribute potential round effect inflation increase price secondhalf underlie fundamental strength economy resilient banking sector assessment transitional period malaysian economy potential reestablish medium term growth path base assessment decide overnight rate unchanged malaysian economy perform firsthalf net epected eperience challenge environment risk high inflation slow growth increase considerably assessment slow global growth protract significant slowdown number developed economy moderation growth emerge economy time commodity energy price epected remain elevate level fuel inflation global economy performance malaysian economy firsthalf driven robust domestic demand reinforce favourable eport performance recent major restructuring domestic energy price bring price closer substantially high international price intend reduce fundamental distortion create ensure fiscal sustainability adjustment epected deflationary effect economy half early part adjustment high international energy commodity price translate high domestic consumer price consumer price inflation increase increase inflation due increase transportation cost increase due high price food nonalcoholic beverage project inflation remain elevate secondhalf early net moderate middle average inflation project range inflation rate epected moderate half contet moderate growth environment significant rise inflation due increase fuel price stage concern broader price increase secondround effect result inflation persistent circumstance response order maintain medium term price stability ensure high inflation undermine longer term growth prospect malaysian economy net risk high inflation risk slow growth increase concern avoid fundamental economic slowdown involve high unemployment slow growth contribute potential round effect inflation increase price secondhalf underlie fundamental strength economy resilient banking sector assessment transitional period malaysian economy potential reestablish medium term growth path base assessment decide overnight rate unchanged,100.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24444444444444444
81,26-May-08,0,3.5,"At the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) meeting today, Bank Negara Malaysia decided to leave the Overnight Policy Rate (OPR) unchanged at 3.50 percent.The Malaysian economy has continued to perform well during the first quarter of 2008, driven by strong domestic demand. Furthermore, while exports of electrical and electronic products have contracted, net exports have remained firm, supported by stronger exports of commodities and resource-based manufactured goods. However, there is now clearer evidence of the slowing growth in the major economies. This moderation in growth is expected to be felt by the regional economies, including Malaysia, during the second half of the year.Despite the signs of slowing global growth, commodity and food prices have continued to increase. In particular, oil prices have spiralled up in recent weeks. Domestic consumer price inflation in Malaysia increased to 3 percent in April 2008 and is primarily being driven by higher food prices. There are strong upside risks to global inflation due to sustained high food and energy prices. While such pressures are likely to ease should global growth moderate, in the more immediate term, domestic price pressures are likely to be sustained.The MPC views the latest data on key international and domestic economic variables as being supportive of its assessment that going forward, the risks to inflation are on the upside, while the risks to growth are on the downside. Should the balance of risks shift towards higher inflation, the Bank will undertake the appropriate monetary policy measures. At this stage the risks are assessed to be about balanced, and consequently, the Bank has decided to maintain the current stance of monetary policy.

82,29-Apr-08,0,3.5,"At the Monetary Policy Committee meeting today, Bank Negara Malaysia decided to leave the Overnight Policy Rate (OPR) unchanged at 3.50 percent.The latest available data from the major industrial economies indicate a moderation of economic activity in these countries. This is likely to lead to slower global growth in the months ahead. While the slower external demand will have some moderating impact on the Malaysian economy, growth continues to be supported by an expansion in domestic demand. The strong imports of capital goods, manufacturing investment approvals and foreign direct investment inflows are indicators of sustained investment activity. Despite the global financial turmoil, domestic credit conditions have remained favourable as demand for financing continues to be supported by the ample liquidity in the financial system.Global energy and food prices have risen sharply since the beginning of the year from their already high levels. A major uncertainty at this stage is the extent of the moderation in global economic activity and the impact it will have in reducing global price pressures. Domestic food prices have risen in response to the increase in global prices. The increase in food prices reflect a structural phenomenon requiring measures that ensure the adequacy of supply, create appropriate incentive structures that promote higher food production, and enhance the efficiency of the production and distribution chain. In order to ensure a smooth transition to market prices, adjustments to administered prices need to be gradual. The Bank’s forecast of 2.5-3% average inflation in 2008 has built in some administered price adjustments. The upside risks to this projection would be dependent on the degree to which the increase in global prices have an impact on domestic prices and the extent to which administered prices are adjusted.There have been increased uncertainties surrounding global economic and financial conditions.

A major uncertainty over global growth is the likely impact of persistently high global oil prices. Nevertheless, continued growth in Malaysia’s major export markets, combined with sustained domestic consumption will continue to support growth.Recent data have shown inflation edging up, reflecting adjustments to rising costs resulting from higher input prices. The inflation level is expected to continue to be affected by cost-driven factors, given the sustained high global oil prices. The cumulative impact of previous price adjustments will cause inflation to peak in the third quarter of 2005, and to moderate thereafter. Productivity increases, capacity expansions and competitive pressures are playing a strong mitigating role in containing inflationary pressures.In an environment where inflation has increased, the level of monetary accommodation will be balanced to ensure that the maximum sustainable growth is achieved in an environment of price stability.

The export sector is expected to continue to support growth in an environment of greater resilience of the world economy to higher oil prices and amidst expectations for a moderation in global demand for IT products. On the domestic front, private sector demand is expected to be supported by rising disposable incomes, positive investor sentiment, stable employment conditions, favourable commodity prices and improved earnings of the corporate sector. The expansion of the Malaysian economy continues to be well supported by strong underlying fundamentals.Inflation, as measured by the Consumer Price Index, rose at an annual rate of 1.6% in the period July to October 2004, reflecting the impact of higher transportation charges following the increase in retail petrol prices and the impact of higher taxes on cigarettes and alcoholic beverages. Nevertheless, inflation is expected to average at or below 1.5% in 2004 (January – October: 1.2%).
