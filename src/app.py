        - This app uses [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) and the [Palmer Penguins](https://allisonhorst.github.io/palmerpenguins/) dataset.      
        - To see the full code check out the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/discdiver/data-viz-streamlit).
        - Plots are interactive where that's the default or easy to add.
        - Plots that use MatPlotlib under the hood have fig and ax objects defined before the code shown.
        - Lineplots should have sequence data, so I created a date index with a sequence of dates for them. 
        - Where an axis label shows by default, I left it at is. Generally where it was missing, I added it.
        - There are multiple ways to make some of these plots.
        - You can choose to see two columns, but with a narrow screen this will switch to one column automatically.
        - Python has many data visualization libraries. This gallery is not exhaustive. If you would like to add code for another library, please submit a [pull request](https://github.com/discdiver/data-viz-streamlit).
        - For a larger tour of more plots, check out the [Python Graph Gallery](https://www.python-graph-gallery.com/density-plot/) and [Python Plotting for Exploratory Data Analysis](https://pythonplot.com/).
        - The interactive Plotly Express 3D Scatterplot is cool to play with. Check it out! ðŸ˜Ž
